While we are a brand of vibrant color, stricter emphasis on legibility and contrast, in alignment
with ADA standards, has driven our latest palette. Itâ€™s been streamlined to 5 color families,
plus gray and black.
The colors have been carefully formulated with specific RGB/HEX and CMYK values. Refer to
this color usage chart to ensure your design meets the legibility needs of our audiences.
